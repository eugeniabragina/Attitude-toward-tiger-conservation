# Attitude-toward-tiger-conservation
This code uses logistic regression to explore the attitude toward Amur tiger conservation at Russian Far East. With poaching remaining the main threat for endangered tigers, decision makers need to know what makes people less likely to protect and more likely to shoot at tigers.  
We use multiple (gender, age, income level etc) to see can impacts the attitude. Attitude is a binary variable i.e. each respondent either support tiger conservation or don't. 
The data used are coming from a survey of ~ 1000 respondents.
